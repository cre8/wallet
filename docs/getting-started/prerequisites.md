- node v20 (https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager)
- pnpm v8 (v9 has some issues with the nx workspace)
- editor [plugin for nx](https://nx.dev/getting-started/editor-setup) (optional)

For an easy development setup, it is recommend to use vscode with the nx plugin to start tasks like building, testing and linting or to generate new code. You can also use Webstorm with the nx plugin, [see here](https://nx.dev/getting-started/editor-setup#official-integrations).
